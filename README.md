# ArmstrongNumber

Armstrong Number:

A number with n digits which the sum of every digit by n-exponent of the number equals to itself is an "Armstrong number"

ex: 153 (3 digits) => 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153, 153 is an Armstrong number

ex: 12 (2 digits) => 1^2 + 2^2 = 1 + 4 = 5 != 12, 12 isn't an Armstrong number
